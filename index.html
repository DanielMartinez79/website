        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Daniel Martinez. I recently graduated from California State University, Long Beach with a Bachelor's of
            Science in Computer Science. I transferred there from Antelope Valley College, where I received an Associate's
            Degree in Computer Software Development in 2015.</p>

        <h2> Personal Projects</h2>
        <h3>Website</h3>
        <p>
            I started this site in order to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and Nodejs using a Raspberrry Pi 
            as a headless server. I have since moved the server to an AWS EC2 instance and made it responsive 
            based on what device it is being viewed on.
        </p>
        <h3>
            RepCount
        </h3>
        <p> Currently working on a web app that lets users record the volume of their workouts and 
            store it in a database in order to track their long-term progress.
        </p>
        <h3>FileMover </h3>
        <h4> <a href="https://github.com/DanielMartinez79/FileMover-Cpp-" target="_blank">Source code</a> </h4>
        <p> A C++ program that moves files from one location to another using regular expressions to search for keywords in file
            names. </p>

        <h2> Coursework</h2>
        <h3>Senior Group Project: SpeakUp</h3>
        <p> A year-long assignment which consisted of proposing an idea for a software program and then planning, designing,
            documenting and producing it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cross-platform mobile and web app that could be used by students and teachers to chat during lectures </li>
            <li>
            Gathered requirements, identified use cases, designed architecture and produced requirements analysis document
                </li>
            <li> Utilized HTML5, CSS3 and TypeScript with Ionic framework </li>
            <li> Agile methodology with daily Scrum meetings </li>
            <li> Final product can be found at <a href="https://speakup.host/" target="_blank">SpeakUp.host</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Distributed Systems Term Project</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a program that could synchronize files between 2 or more computers on the
            same network using peer-to-peer architecture.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coded in Python</li>
            <li>Synchronize files from a designated folder </li>
            <li>Synch based on which file was most recently modified</li>
            <li>Multi-threaded: one thread acts as client and another thread acts as server</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Software Engineering Term Project </h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the software engineering process. We were tasked with
            pitching an idea, gathering requirements, designing the architecture and ultimately producing a requirement analysis
            document. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a review app similar to Yelp</li>
            <li>Used the Waterfall methodology</li>
            <li>Produced documents such as request for proposal, use cases, sequence diagrams and requirements analysis document
                </li>
        </ul>
