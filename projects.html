        <h3>Senior Group Project: SpeakUp</h3>
        <p> A year-long assignment which consisted of pitching an idea for a software program, planning,
            designing and documenting it, and then actually building it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cross-platform mobile and web app that could be used by students and teacher to chat during lectures. </li>
            <li>
            Gathered requirements, identified use cases and produced requirement analysis document </li>
            <li> HTML5, CSS3 and Typescript with Ionic framework </li>
            <li> Agile methodology with daily Scrum meetings </li>
            <li> Final product can be found at
                <a href="https://speakup.host/" target="_blank">SpeakUp.host</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Distributed Systems Term Project</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a program that could synchronize files between 2 
            or more computers on the same network using peer-to-peer architecture.
            <ul>
                <li>Coded in Python</li>
                <li>Synchs files from a designated folger based on which file was most recently modified</li>
                <li>Multi-threaded: one thread acts as client and another thread acts as server</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Software Engineering Term Project
        </h3>
        <p>This purpose of this project was to go through the software engineering process. We had to
            pitch an idea, gather requirements, design the architecture and ultimately produce a requirment
            analysis document.
            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a review app simialr to Yelp</li>
            <li>Used the Waterfall methodology, producing extensive documentation</li>
            <li>Produced documents such as request for proposal, use cases, sequence diagrams and 
                requirment analysis document
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Language Strucute Projects</h3>
        <p>Tasked with multiple lab projects throughout the semester</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Created a memory allocator in C </li>
            <li> Created a program in Prolog that could solve logic puzzles</li>
            <li> Imitated a v-table in C</li>
        </ul>
