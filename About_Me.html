            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Daniel Martinez. I recently graduated from California State University, Long Beach with a Bachelor of
                Science in Computer Science. I transferred there from Antelope Valley College, where I graduated in 2015 with
                and Associate of Science in Computer Software Development
      
                 </p>
                 <p>          I first became intrigued by computers when I graduated high school. I wanted to build my own gaming PC and so
                        I decided to actually do it. Ever since then, I've been interested in both the hardware and software aspects
                        of computers.</p>
