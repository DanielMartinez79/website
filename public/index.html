        <h2> Coursework</h2>
        <h3>Senior Group Project: SpeakUp</h3>
        <p> A year-long assignment which consisted of proposing an idea for a software program and then planning, designing,
            documenting and producing it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Cross-platform mobile and web app that could be used by students and teachers to chat during lectures </li>
            <li>
            Gathered requirements, identified use cases, designed architecture and produced requirements analysis document
                </li>
            <li> Utilized HTML5, CSS3 and TypeScript with Ionic framework </li>
            <li> Agile methodology with daily Scrum meetings </li>
            <li> <a href="https://speakup.host/" target="_blank"> Final product can be found here</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Distributed Systems Term Project</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a program that could synchronize files between 2 or more computers on the
            same network using peer-to-peer architecture.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coded in Python</li>
            <li>Synchronize files from a designated folder </li>
            <li>Synch based on which file was most recently modified</li>
            <li>Multi-threaded: one thread acts as client and another thread acts as server</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Software Engineering Term Project </h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the software engineering process. We were tasked with
            pitching an idea, gathering requirements, designing the architecture and ultimately producing a requirement analysis
            document. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a review app similar to Yelp</li>
            <li>Used the Waterfall methodology</li>
            <li>Produced documents such as request for proposal, use cases, sequence diagrams and requirements analysis document
                </li>
        </ul>
