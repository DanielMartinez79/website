            <h3>Senior Group Project: SpeakUp</h3>
            <p> A year-long assignment which consisted of proposing an idea for a software program and then planning, designing,
                documenting and producing it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Cross-platform mobile and web app that could be used by students and teachers to chat during lectures </li>
                <li> Gathered requirements, identified use cases, designed architecture and produced requirements analysis document
                    </li>
                <li> Utilized HTML5, CSS3 and TypeScript with Ionic framework </li>
                <li> Agile methodology with daily Scrum meetings </li>
                <li> <a href="https://speakup.host/" target="_blank"> Final product can be found here</a> </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Distributed Systems Term Project</h3>
            <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a program that could synchronize files between 2 or more computers
                on the same network using peer-to-peer architecture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coded in Python</li>
                <li>Synchronize files from a designated folder </li>
                <li>Synch based on which file was most recently modified</li>
                <li>Multi-threaded: one thread acts as client and another thread acts as server</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Software Engineering Term Project </h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with the software engineering process. We were tasked
                with pitching an idea, gathering requirements, designing the architecture and ultimately producing a requirement
                analysis document. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a review app similar to Yelp</li>
